    "Last summer, the European Commission called on the European Union to \"accept that the withdrawal of troops is a factor of victory for security\" and promised that a US proposal to transfer 3,000 US troops to northern Europe could be finalized as early as next year",
    " This suggestion may be greeted by alarm bells within the European Union",
    " But, as expected, the Polish prime minister, Yaczek Lusk, has already said he is still working on this, and wants the withdrawal to be \"fully agreed on with the White House",
    "\"Indeed, the European Commission said it is taking steps to allow the withdrawal of US troops and \"decontaminate\" any plans to move a large number of US troops into Poland and beyond",
    "But that is far from a complete consensus",
    " President Obama and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, both of whom are prepared to defend the need for the withdrawal, have indicated they are not going to send a large contingent of US troops",
    " The President has also refused to sign the UN Security Council resolution condemning Poland's \"illegal\" participation in the Warsaw Summit",
    " It is worth noting that the statement says that the President \"does not have sufficient authority to conclude an independent diplomatic process with Poland that would not threaten European security or peace in the long run",
    "\"Meanwhile, there are already a lot of calls for the deployment of NATO's forces to Poland and the Warsaw summit, but it is still not possible to actually prepare for the withdrawal",
    " This is especially so for NATO members",
    " To send back troops and send a message to the American people, if President Trump is truly serious about the goal of a continued NATO expansion, he will have to negotiate with the Poles on this issue",
    "An EU member can take a hard line, but even more likely, the European Union is going to need to do what it can to avoid doing so",
    " It is now clear that many European leaders, including Poland's prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, and the heads of the US, EU and European Commission have long regarded any return to their own countries as a sign of weakness, as if it was a sign that the EU had not got what it was asking for",
    "Now, as a matter of fact, the Commission has at least signaled that it will be beginning to talk to Poland about the issue of troop movements, and the actions that may be taking place to try to broker a solution, if that is so",
    "That doesn't mean there is no work to be done to avoid the situation",
    " The National Council for Refugees (NCCRP), which has not provided the initial estimate of what a war might be like for Poland, has been called on by the European Union to get the number of troops that it has received from the US on hand to a level that can be verified",
    " But, it is not the final figure",
    "So, to those European leaders, there is hope that the withdrawal of American troops and, if possible, an increase in the number of US troops could help Poland",
    " That might also help the Poles in negotiating with the US",
    "Another good thing about the upcoming Russian military exercises is that they would give the EU some leverage in what is going on",
    " Russia is very much a policy-driven country, which means it does not have the right to intervene in its own affairs",

    " People see Buddhism as the most basic way of life",
    " It is the science of being in yourself, free of the outside forces of the world",

    " Try to Talk to the People Who Know Buddhism",
    "One of the most important things to do with living Buddhism is talking to people who are different from you",

    " They can share their experiences with you, talk to you about your life, and create a deeper understanding",
    " They can also share their experiences with other people who also share their experiences with Buddhism",

    " Teach People Respect for Other People's Beliefs",
    "This is where I get a lot of anxiety",

    " You might be a Buddhist, you might be a Buddhist Buddhist, you might be a Buddhist, but you're going to have to be respectful of those beliefs that you're seeing in the world",
    "Now, there are a lot of people who aren't Buddhist, but who think that they are",
    " This can be difficult, and I know it can be very difficult to do, because you have to always be respectful of other people's beliefs",
    " So, I try to teach people who are more knowledgeable about Buddhism, who share their experiences with me, and also share their experiences with other people who share their experiences with Buddhism",

    " This Court's dissent has long been a natural fit for the Court to come to a decisive decision on the issue of how to interpret the Constitution",
    " As the Ninth Circuit has had repeatedly said, there is no need to revisit this issue in light of the essential distinction between religious freedom and personal liberty, nor to explore the extent to which the central holding in Louisiana's First Amendment rights encompasses the Establishment Clause",
    "\"\"As many Louisiana families have made clear, the statute providing for the exclusion of religious activity by certain colleges and universities from any public school district should not be interpreted to restrict the freedom of school speech and religion",
    " Instead, the statute will be used to control the behavior of students and institutions by prohibiting both [those students and institutions] and by other State governments from infringing the exercise of religious rights",
    "\"\"The Code of Civil Procedure provides that \"[o]n fall of any university district, religious school, or society shall be subject to all the consequences of having the rule of law abrogated, or failing to apply it, must be dismissed from public schools",
    "\"\"There is no cause of action for a particular public or political subdivision of a state over the acts, beliefs, or practices of the school district and any of its administrators",
    "Never to suffer would never to have been blessed",
    " Indeed, the Lord will take you to be, and you will be the only ones to hear the voices of those who ask you to be",
    " For it is a simple principle: if you be willing, I will have you",
    " Now that you have found your way, you have not to be afraid of your fate",
    " And the Lord will forgive you, even if you fear it",
    " For if you find yourself surrounded by people who take you by the hand and bow to you, that may be the saving thing in the world",
    " For it is a plain truth that none of the righteous can know what they are before they know God, and all the prophets said: if you do not become God, God is not at all ready to give you help",
    " Therefore, I ask you, keep working, or you will be led astray",
    " But your success is in God's glory, and it is only through faith that you will find your way",
    " For it is not in faith that you can be saved, but in the Holy Spirit who sends you to be saved by his authority",
    " For by this way you must be humble in humility, and you must have humility in mind, because that will increase your spirit and your sense of self",
    " For humility is a means of control, and all the same, it is the constant force that all men must be constantly moving and commanding in order to make this world a better place for themselves",
    " It is in this way that you must know the way, and it is in this way that you must keep moving and directing, because it is at that time that you will reach the perfection of being one with the world",
    " And God will show you, not only how to be obedient to your Creator, but how to be self-sufficient in the world",
    " Thus, let not you be afraid of the name of God",
    " For as the Lord will bless you, so will the Lord bless you",
    "And the Word of God was great in this world, but it was lost",
    " Therefore, before you may find your way, you must face the Lord",
    " And the Lord will help you",
    " But remember, that you have not known that you are in danger",
    " You are about to encounter danger, for as you approach the Lord you must become aware of the fact that there is danger",
    " This is the power of this hour in the world",
    " And as you walk toward the Lord and you understand the danger you must get ready to face it",
    " For before you know how the Lord will help you, you must be willing to go into battle, and as he will help you he will also help you",
    " So, don't you feel that you need to carry on as if nothing was done? And what will you do if you don't? For if you don't look for the Lord, you will go to the sea, and your feet will become of no use to the Lord",
    " And your heart will turn on the Lord",
    " He will judge you, and he will do what is right and not evil",
    " And so, on this day you will be with God, and you will go to him to save the world",
    " And he will give you peace, even though you have been living in darkness",
    " And that day you will go to God, and He will be his and your life will be",
    " And He will give you hope, because He has received you from darkness",
    " And there is no fear in this world, but there is faith in the Lord",
    " For faith in the Lord is a blessing to all the people",
    "The passage continuesAnd you who have read this from the glory of God have heard the word of the Lord, as it were, that there are many who want to be just and true in the ways of the world, and even yet live in darkness",
    "And when the Lord saw you, he gave you one consolation, that he may not disappoint you with words",
    " And he led you to dwell in the Lord's house, and to see him",
    "And when you heard him, you were a little lost in thought, because you were not expecting much",
    "But after you were scattered about in the darkness, he taught you, saying: \"Speak, O my Savior",
    " Hear what I have to say to you; I will take you away from you and give you to the light of God",
    " You shall see the Lord in heaven, and you shall see his face in the waters",
    " And you shall love me, O Lord",
    "\"And he made you an equal among his angels, and he brought you to him with a voice to the land, saying: \"May you see the Lord in the land of the living God",
    "\" And you did not understand, because you heard the voice",
    "But now you have reached the Lord, who has given you the promise of eternal life, who has been made perfect in the ways of the world",
    "We suffer more often in imagination than in reality",
    " One has to identify with those whose past are cut off from the present moment",
    " This, of course, is a characteristic that others may not have",
    " On the contrary, such will become increasingly inflexible with time, as we all experience greater uneasiness when there is more than one present moment",
    " In time, we will have to act differently from the original future",
    "The science of conceptual interpretation holds that what we perceive or remember can be linked to the things in our lives",
    " That is to say, experience, cognition, and so on are bound together by the present moment, whereas some things can be seen as \"wrong\" as well",
    " The problem, then, is how we will respond to such possibilities",
    " If you ask me, then, that I have to choose between trying to understand what the subconscious can tell me, or attempting to see what this new world will look like, then I can understand the world differently",
    " But do you understand the world differently?It would be a great pleasure to do that",

    " I don't know what led to it, and I don't even know why it came up",
    "This might be the first time I have actually met someone who is making games, but what drew me to this project was not a race between creators, but how far back you can go in your own personal journey",

    " I feel for some creators and, sadly, not all",
    "Q: What made you decide to pursue the next Kickstarter project?J",
