Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.
I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams. Live the life you have imagined.
It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop.
A man who stands for nothing will fall for anything.
Those who say it can’t be done are usually interrupted by others doing it.
My whole teaching consists of two words, meditation and love. Meditate so that you can feel immense silence, and love so that your life can become a song, a dance, a celebration.
You can build your own things that other people can use. And once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.
Timeless: Science, math, philosophy, rhetoric, first principles, creating art and business, family and lifelong friends, habits to calm mind and body. Temporary: Politics, news, entertainment, memorizing facts, hourly work, transactional relationships, drugs and doctors for mind and body.
Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create.
Life changes for the better when we realize that we don’t have to know everything and we don’t have to pretend that we do. 
The worst decision of all is none.
Wisdom starts when you no longer need short-term rewards.
Time is a created thing. To say “I don’t have time”, is like saying, “I don’t want to”.
Never to suffer would never to have been blessed.
We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.
People do not lack strength; they lack will.
Take time like the river that never grows stale. Keep going and steady. No hurry, no rush.
When you’re young, you want to be rich. When you’re rich, you want to be young.
We do not appreciate how brief and fleeting our lives will be. It is always later than you think. Time is always more precious than you realize. Realize it now and act!
