Find out what people are saying in online discussions and forums

Forums can be a useful place to find first-hand advice, and to learn from people who have experience with something you’re interested in. We’ve heard from you that you want to see more of this content in Search, so we’ve been exploring new ways to make it easier to find. Starting today, a new feature will appear when you search for something that might benefit from the diverse personal experiences found in online discussions.

The new feature, labeled “Discussions and forums,” will include helpful content from a variety of popular forums and online discussions across the web. For example, if you search for the best cars for a growing family, in addition to other web results, you’ll now see links to forum posts that include relevant advice from people, like their experience with minivans for transporting multiple children.

Today it will be rolling out for English users on mobile in the U.S. As with all Search features, we’ll continue to learn about whether people are finding this new feature valuable over time, and may update it in the future as we learn what’s most useful for people.
